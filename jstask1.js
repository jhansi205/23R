Console.log(x);
var x = 5; //o/p:undefined
//Explanation : concept of hoisting a variable in javascript variable moved to the top of their scope before code execution .so we assign number does not take .
//2.
Console.log(a);
var x = 5; //o/p:undefined
//Explanation : concept of hoisting a variable in javascript variable moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
//3.
console.log(b);
b = 10;
var b; //o/p:undefined
//Explanation : concept of hoisting a variable in javascript variable moved to the top of their scope before code execution .so we assign number does not take .
//4.
console.log(c); //o/p: Reference error c is not defined.
//Explanation : Here try to accessing a variable in the code we are not declare any variable so without declaration we cannot access any variable
//5.
console.log(e);
var e = 10;
console.log(e);
e = 20;
console.log(e); //o/p: undefined
//10
//20
//Explanation: step:1-variable is declared but not assigned a value then output will be undefined.
//Step2: variable e has been assigned value 10. then output will be 10
//Step3: : variable e has been assigned value 20. then output will be 20
//6.
Console.log(f);
var f = 100;
var f;
console.log(f); //o/p: undefined
//100
//Explanation: - step1: variable is declared but not assigned a value then output will be undefined.
//Step2: variable f has been assigned value 100.then output will be 100
//Step3: there is not effect on f because variable already declared
//7.
console.log(g);
var g = g + 1;
console.log(g); //o/p: undefined
//NaN
//Explanation: trying to add two different data types that is number and string we canâ€™t add by using + operator so then output will be NaN
//8.
var h;
console.log(h);
h = 58;
console.log(h);
//o/p:undefined
//58
//Explanation: step1: concept of hoisting a variable in javascript variable moved to the top of their scope before code execution .so we assign number does not take .
//Step2: variable h has been assigned value 58.
//9.
console.log(t);
t = 16;
var t = 5;
console.log(t);
//o/p: undefined
//5
//Explanation: step1: concept of hoisting a variable in javascript variable moved to the top of their scope before code execution .so we assign number does not take .
//Step2: In java script excecution done one -by-one so we assign a value same variable it takes recent assigned value this occurs in this program
